# Comrade NEXT

The next rewrite of my personal Discord bot, using [`nextcord`](https://github.com/nextcord/nextcord).

The goal of this bot is to become a long-term maintainable bot that I can use for the next several years. It will represent the culmination of nearly 4 years of work on my original version of Comrade which started in 2019.

## Features

* Integrated dynamic emoji system - swap emojis in and out on the fly, replicating Nitro's increased emoji limit

## Good Practices

* Built-in patcher - easily update the bot from the latest version of the repository
* Tests - unit tests for library functions, and some integration tests as well
